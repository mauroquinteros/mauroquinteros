## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer, I'm from Peru. Passionate about backend development, with 3 years of experience, primarily in startups and companies in the financial sector. I enjoy working on personal projects focused on improving my productivity. Currently, I am learning frontend development to expand my skill set.

I am curious, analytical, and resilient: if I don't understand something, I wonâ€™t stop until I find the solution.
